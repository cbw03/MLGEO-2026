Evaluating the effectiveness of an AI/ML model [Evaluating AI/ML Model Performance](https://www.ll.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publication/doc/principles-evaluation-aiml-model-performance-brown-md-62.pdf):
1. Using a train validation test split is very important to prevent overfitting and get as close to the true model as possible. 
2. Testing the models sensitivity by slightly altering the input, a good model should be able to maintain performance despite these changes. 
3. Use more advanced metrics, simple ones can easily be misleading, such as accuracy where a model that memorizes the data will do very well in.
4. It is important to consider trade-offs between model performance and how long it would take to reach that performance
5. When assessing a model using a loss and cost function, plotting to see over epochs visualizes where to select the best point for the final model.
